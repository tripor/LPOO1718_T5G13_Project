### Design Patterns
 - `Factory Method` : The Entity class and Place class
 - `Object Pool` : GameStage make 400 materials and 400 persons that can be used. After use they are put in a array for later use
 - `Singleton` : Use in Map and GameStage
 - `Composite` : Entity is the top of the tree
 - `Decorator` : Place is a decorator and factory/house/mine/smelter reimplement diferent ways the place works 
 - `Facade` : Entity represents all things that apear in the map
 - `Command` : Mouse, UserControl and Icons catch the user requests and clicks
 - `Template method` : Entity handler is redefined in the lower classes.They implement a algoritm that is diferent for from each other
