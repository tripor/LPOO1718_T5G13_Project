### Behavioural Aspects

### Design Patterns
 - `Factory Method`
 - `Object Pool`
 Used the two design in combination
 - `Composite` : A tree structure of simple and composite objects
 - `Facade` : A single class that represents an entire subsystem
 - `State` : Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
 - `Strategy` : Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
